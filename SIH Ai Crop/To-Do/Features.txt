1. Not just crop recommendation -> suggests 3-5 year rotation plan to maintain soil fertility & prevent pest cycles.

1.2 Climate-Resilient Crop Prediction : Uses climate change models (rainfall variability, temperature trends) to suggest crops that will remain viable for the next 5-10 years.
1.3 Market Demand Forecasting : Integrates mandi + export data to recommend crops with future price growth → ensuring farmers don’t just grow, but grow profitably.
1.4 Pest & Disease Risk Alerts : Predicts pest outbreak likelihood (based on season + crop + region) and suggests resistant crop varieties.
1.5 AI-Powered Crop Selection -> ML model integrates soil, water availability, historical yields, weather, and market data.
Risk & Sustainability Index -> For each crop, system scores:
Profitability (market price trends + input cost)
Water footprint & soil health impact
Climate resilience & pest vulnerability
Model Reliability -> Uses XGBoost to increase accuracy on user feedback and past incorrect predictions, thus increasing the reliability overall.
Image Detection -> Another model, which mainly focuses on scanning crop diseases and warn the farmer.
Offline First Approach -> Farmers manually enter soil/water/crop details offline; system works without internet and syncs when connected.
Farmer-Friendly Interface -> Intuitive design with icons, infographics, and regional languages.
Innovation -> Unlike static apps, our platform is dynamic, adaptive, and sustainability-driven, making agriculture future-proof.

2. SIMPLE UI

2.1 No Hassle with Login Or Registeration, start right away!
2.2 Selected Region once selected, is saved and can be retrieved whenever the app is opened again.
2.3 Saves most of the information in a compressed format, so that app launch is fast.
2.4 Get all information about the region's trending crops, temperature, rainfall, sunlight intensity and market predictions for your current crop at one place in a form of a dashboard!
2.5 Retrieve various kinds of manuals at one place!
2.6 Two tabs with 6+ functionalities.

3. OFFLINE MODE 

3.1 Downloads graphs, region info and other information in a compressed format to use it for areas with no internet.
3.2 When no connectivity, the farmer can manually enter details for crop recommendation.
3.3 System works without internet and syncs when connected.

4. MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT AND VOICE SUPPORT

4.1 Uses Bhashini API, which has various models to support translation of 22+ official languages!
4.2 For voice translation, the same API is used, making it easier to keep the application less dependent on too many resources.
4.3 Promotes Made In India by using most of data from the Government and Indian APIs.
